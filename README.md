# Interview for Node.js with Typescript

Interview Steps:

1. Fix the App
    * You should be able to browse `http://localhost:3000` and see a "_Hello World_" message
    * You should be able to browse `http://localhost:3000/api/todos` and see a set of TODOs
2. Add a new `GET - /api/intents` endpoint to expose the contents of `intents.json` 
3. Call the new endpoint from any front end application (_Tip: What happens when HTTP calls are made between different hosts???_)

You can use google, libraries, etc

# Getting Started

To run this application:
1. Clone it!
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/OscarDHdz/interview-nodejs.git
    ```
2. Install dependencies

    npm install
    ```
3. Run in Dev mode (auto refresh when an file is saved)

# Troubleshoothing
If for any reason the `npm run dev` command does no run in your machine, try running `npm start` to start the application.
